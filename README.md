# üé¨ IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using Custom AvgWord2Vec Embeddings

This project performs **sentiment classification** on the **IMDb 50K Movie Review Dataset** by training a **custom Word2Vec model from scratch** using `gensim`.  
The model represents each review as an **average Word2Vec vector (AvgWord2Vec)**, and these embeddings are then used to train and compare **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifiers.

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
1. Preprocess movie review text (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, etc.).
2. Train a Word2Vec model from scratch on the dataset.
3. Represent each review as the average of its word embeddings (**AvgWord2Vec**).
4. Train and evaluate multiple ML models to classify reviews as **positive** or **negative**.

- **Classes**:  
  - `positive` sentiment  
  - `negative` sentiment
- **Distribution**: Balanced (25K positive, 25K negative)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing Steps

1. **Lowercasing** all text.
2. **Removing HTML tags**.
3. **Removing punctuation**.
4. **Tokenizing** the reviews into words.
5. **Removing stopwords** (using `nltk` stopwords list).
6. **Stemming** words using the Porter Stemmer.
7. **Training custom Word2Vec** model using `gensim` on the processed corpus.
8. Creating **AvgWord2Vec vectors** by averaging all word embeddings in a review.

## üìä Model Training

Three classifiers were trained using the AvgWord2Vec feature vectors:

| Model                | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression  | **85%**  |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | **85%**  |
| Random Forest        | **82%**  |
